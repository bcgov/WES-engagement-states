    "This summary presents the different states of employee engagement for your organization in 2015 and how these states have changed since 2013. The organization population used for this analysis is based on information from the Corporate Human Resource and Information Payroll System (CHIPS) file extracted on August 30, 2011. Due to the considerable amount of organizational change that occurred in the BC Public Service from 2013 and 2015, BC Stats used employees' job position numbers to map their various 2013 and 2015 migration scenarios into the new organization structures. Therefore, the employee counts in this report may not correspond with the employee totals reported previously in the 2013 and 2015 organization reports."
